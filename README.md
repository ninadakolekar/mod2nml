# MOD to NML Translator
### CS6383 - Introduction to Compiler Engineering

This repository is a part of the CS6383 Course Project done under the guidance of Dr. Ramakrishna Upadrasta and Dr. Gayathri P K. The objective is to build a langugae translator that can automatically translate code written in NMODL to NeuroML - two programming frameworks used heavily in computational neuroscience.

The need for a translator stems from the need to convert a pile of legacy code written in NMODL to more pupular and modern frameworks such as NeuroML. To the best of our knowledge, no such translators existed when this project was completed. The translator has been implemented using core fundamentals of langugage compilers and power of regular expressions.
